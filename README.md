About Dataset
This dataset provides information on changes in global surface temperature across all countries from 1970 to 2021. It includes data on temperature variations over a 51-year period and is based on information from various sources, including weather stations, satellites, and ocean buoys. The dataset allows for the analysis of temperature trends in different countries and regions, as well as the identification of areas that are particularly vulnerable to temperature shifts. This information can be used to better understand the impacts of climate change and to inform policy decisions aimed at mitigating these impacts.The Temperature measure by the unit of degree celcious, If The temperature increasing the index is possitive and when the temperature is decreasing the index is negative.
