# Who is Paying the Highest Bill for the Biggest Economies CO2 Emission?

### Introduction:
This project aims to explore the relationship between carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and climate change by analyzing two datasets. The first dataset contains information on CO2 emissions from 1990 to 2019 for over 200 countries, while the second dataset provides data on changes in global surface temperature across all countries from 1970 to 2021.

### Project Goal:
The primary goal of this project is to identify which countries are most affected by climate change and CO2 emissions. Additionally, the project aims to analyze the correlation between CO2 emissions and temperature change in these countries.

### Dataset Explanation:
The first dataset used in this project is from the World Bank and provides information on CO2 emissions for different countries over the past 30 years. The data is reported in metric tons of CO2 equivalent per year and can be used to analyze trends and identify countries with the highest CO2 emissions. The second dataset is from Kaggle and provides information on temperature variations across all countries over a 51-year period. The data is based on information from various sources, including weather stations, satellites, and ocean buoys. The dataset allows for the analysis of temperature trends in different countries and regions, as well as the identification of areas that are particularly vulnerable to temperature shifts.

#### CO2 emission dataset: https://databank.worldbank.org/reports.aspx?source=2&Topic=19

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the datasets, the project concluded that countries most affected by climate change are not necessarily the biggest CO2 emitters. Additionally, the biggest CO2 emitters do not appear to have as much impact on climate change as previously thought. The results are presented in a Tableau dashboard, which highlights which countries are most affected by climate change and CO2 emissions.

### Further Studies:
In future studies, it would be beneficial to further analyze the correlation between CO2 emissions and temperature change in different countries. This could help identify the key drivers of climate change and inform policy decisions aimed at mitigating its impacts. Additionally, it would be useful to analyze the impact of climate change on other factors, such as food security, health, and the economy, to better understand the broader implications of climate change.
